# Quilt

A comfy, muted syntax theme for Atom.

This theme will most likely look fine in other languages, but I have only chosen a few languages for demoing purposes.

## Special Thanks!

This theme was created using [Allen Bargi's](https://github.com/aziz) awesome [tmTheme-Editor](https://github.com/aziz/tmTheme-Editor)!

All example code shown below was captured from his color scheme editor as well.
